## Key Findings

### Strengths
- 4-layer architecture is well-designed
- Excellent documentation (benchmark)
- One-click install and auto-start
- Solves real pain points (WPS development, browser compatibility)
- Active development with CI/CD

### Issues to Address

#### High Priority
1. **Test Coverage** - Current thresholds too low (branches: 5%, functions: 20%), need to increase to 60%/70%
2. **Launcher Security Model** - No authentication on localhost API, needs documentation

#### Medium Priority
3. **Code Modernization** - ES5 syntax for WPS compatibility needs documentation
4. **Configuration Flexibility** - Hardcoded paths should be extracted to config.js

#### Low Priority
5. Add CONTRIBUTING.md
6. Consider i18n support
